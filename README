Mafia:

You live in a village that has been infiltrated by the mafia. Almost half of the villagers are mafia members.

If you're a mafia member, your goal is to be kill all the villagers.
If you're a villager or detective, your goal is to find all the mafia members before all the villagers die.

The game goes in day and night cycles. 
During the night, the mafia kills one of the villagers in their sleep.
During the day, the entire village decides to choose one person to kill.

If you're a detective, during the night, you can confirm or deny your suspicions about the members of the village.
